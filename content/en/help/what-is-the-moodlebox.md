The MoodleBox is a small footprint mobile device, Internet independent, providing a wireless network for your smartphone, tablet or computer. It provides a complete [Moodle][1] learning management system platform, enabling to supply online learning activities and sharing files with your users.

When connected to the Internet via a wired network (Ethernet), the MoodleBox also provides Internet access to devices connected to it via Wi-Fi.

It is [built][2] around a mini-computer [Raspberry Pi 3][3] and the [Moodle learning environment][1], the most used open source LMS in the world.

The MoodleBox provides a [Moodle][1] learning management system outside of any network infrastructure, by using a small, cheap and versatile device.

It's used to enhance online learning and teaching:

  - where infrastructure is non-existent or inadequate, for example in developing countries;
  - where infrastructure has been destroyed, in the wake of war episodes or natural disasters;
  - when existing infrastructure is not suitable for specific projects, for example when the Internet speed is not fast enough or when the platform provided is not adapted to the usage you need (no plugins, no customization possible, etc.);
  - when it is sensible to provide learning activities offline, without Internet access.

It offers small groups (about 20-30 participants) the opportunity to work in a learning environment without the need for heavy setup.
